- **Project Type**: E-commerce website with product catalog, shopping cart, and authentication
- **Key Features**: Product browsing, cart management, user authentication, contact forms

## Color Scheme Reference
The original project uses a consistent color palette that should be maintained across all Angular components:

### Primary Colors
- **Brand Red**: `#DB4444` (primary buttons, branding, accents)
- **Text White**: `#ffffff` (primary text color)
- **Background**: `linear-gradient(to right, black, rgb(3, 3, 28), rgb(3, 3, 28), black)`

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Use Angular CLI for component generation
- Follow Angular style guide and best practices
- Implement proper TypeScript typing
- Use reactive forms for user inputs
- Maintain consistent code formatting

### Styling Approach
- Use SCSS for all styling
- Create global color variables in `src/styles/variables.scss`
- Implement mobile-first responsive design
- Maintain consistency with original design
- Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts

### State Management
- Use services for shared state (cart, auth)
- Implement localStorage for data persistence
- Use RxJS observables for reactive programming
- Handle loading and error states appropriately

### Testing Strategy
- Write unit tests for components and services
- Test form validation and user interactions
- Verify responsive design on multiple devices
- Test cross-browser compatibility

## Key Features to Implement

- Product browsing and filtering
- Shopping cart with quantity management
- Order placement and confirmation
- User account management

### User Experience
- Real-time clock display
- Interactive product modals
- Success/error message handling
- Mobile-responsive navigation

### Technical Features
- Form validation with custom validators

- SEO-friendly routing

## Dependencies
Make sure to install these key dependencies:
```bash
npm install @angular/material @angular/cdk
npm install @fortawesome/fontawesome-free
npm install rxjs
```

## Deployment Considerations
- Build production version with `ng build --prod`
- Ensure all assets are properly referenced
- Configure environment files for different stages
- Test thoroughly before deployment

## Migration Benefits
- **Modern Framework**: Leverage Angular's powerful features
- **TypeScript**: Better type safety and developer experience
- **Component Architecture**: Reusable and maintainable code
- **Reactive Programming**: Better state management with RxJS
- **Performance**: Optimized bundle sizes and lazy loading
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing capabilities
- **Scalability**: Easier to extend and maintain

## Next Steps
1. Start with Task 1 to set up the foundation
2. Progress through tasks sequentially
3. Test each component thoroughly before moving to the next
4. Maintain regular communication and progress updates
5. Document any deviations or additional requirements

Each task includes detailed implementation guidelines, code examples, and acceptance criteria to ensure successful completion of the Angular migration.
